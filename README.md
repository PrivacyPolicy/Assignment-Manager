# Assignment Manager
A lightweight web app that I created to track my school assignments.
I designed it before I knew Git, so there's no commit history.

## Getting Started
Open `index.html`. Click the 'Classes' button and add your classes.

## Add New Assignment
After you've added classes, you can add assignments. Click the 'New' button.
Then, select your class, name the assignment, and choose the due date.
Then, click 'Apply'
